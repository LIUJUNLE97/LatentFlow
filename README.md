# Abstract
Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow and pressure data during training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder (pC $\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the pC $\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in data-constrained experimental settings.
